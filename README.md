# Yumi
A Discord bot made with TypeScript using NodeJS

# Getting started
## Prerequisite
Make sure you have [`node`](https://nodejs.org/en/ 'NodeJS'), [`npm`](https://npmjs.org/ 'NPM') and [`git`](https://git-scm.com/ 'Git') installed first.
To verify, you can run the [`./verify.sh`](https://github.com/virtous/Yumi/blob/main/verify.sh 'verify.sh') file.
```sh
$ bash ./verify.sh
```
Once you ran that, you can also run the [`./setup.sh`](https://github.com/virtous/Yumi/blob/main/setup.sh 'setup.sh') file.
